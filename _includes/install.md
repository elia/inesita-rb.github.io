## Install

All you need is a working Ruby environment. After that install inesita gem:

```sh
$ gem install inesita
```

Now we can create a sample application:

```sh
$ inesita new inesita_app
```

Change directory

```sh
$ cd inesita_app
```

And run server

```sh
$ bundle exec inesita server
```

Go to [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292). It works. Doesn't it?
